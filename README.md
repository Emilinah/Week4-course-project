What was done.

An R script called run_analysis.R was created which can do the following:-

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Descriptive activity names were used to name the activities in the data set
Also descriptive variable names were used to label the data set.
A new 'tidy data' set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was finally created!

Further description of how the dataset was made tidy appear in the codebook
